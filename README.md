Technologies used

- HTML
- SCSS: variables for colors and text, it is a lot easier to manage styles with words, not numbers. Mixin and nesting for precise style injection.
- Responsive web design
- Jekyll: Layout aid with includes
- GitHub: version control and recovery when necessary.
- Grids: used as the basis for a responsive design, it is very easy to visualize and understand the code from a designer perspective.
- Flexbox: essential to wrap and align elements in the way that was intended in design, for example the contact icons.
- Forms: not used. I do not expect a lot of contacts from this channel and if it is the case I think a form might inhibit a possible client or employer. E-mail is more personal and straight forward.
- Animations: not really necessary, is preferable to keep a minimalistic and fully functional webpage at this stage of a career.
